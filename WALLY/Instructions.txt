# 1.- Clone in your computer:
https://github.com/tensorflow/models

# 2.- Install protoc for WINDOWS

Remember to install the version 3.4.0, as later versions may give you a “Permission Error” when trying to compile. 

https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/tag/v3.4.0

Then, extract the Protobuf download in C:/Users/your-username.

Open command prompt, move to the location of your tensorflow/models/research directory. And run this command.

“C:\Program Files\protoc-3.4.0-win32\bin\protoc.exe” object_detection/protos/*.proto --python_out=.

# 3.- Copy my directory to object_detection

# 4.- Download and extract in ./Train/ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco_11_06_2017/

http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco_11_06_2017.tar.gz

# 5.- Add Libraries to PYTHONPATH. Every time you go to execute it. Remember to use the same cmd to train the model. From tensorflow/models/research/

SET PYTHONPATH=%cd%;%cd%\slim

# 6.- TRAIN.
From ./object_detection/WALLY/Train

python train.py --logtostderr --train_dir=./models/train --pipeline_config_path=ssd_mobilenet_v1_pets.config

You can stop the training whatever you want. We stoped it when the loss was around 0.20. 

# 7.- EXPORT THE FROZEN MODEL. 
From ./object_detection. Remember to check in the folder train/model/ the last epoch, something like this: "model.ckpt-3272" and put the number "3272" in INSERT NUMBER in the next line:

python export_inference_graph.py --input_type image_tensor --pipeline_config_path ./WALLY/Train/ssd_mobilenet_v1_pets.config --trained_checkpoint_prefix ./WALLY/Train/models/train/model.ckpt-[INSERT NUMBER] --output_directory ./WALLY/Train/saved_model

# 7.- EXECUTE THE JUPYTER NOTEBOOK TO PREDICT.
You can find my saved model in Predict Folder and execute the jupyter notebook to check my results.
